Deployment
==========

Since Scorestack is a bit complicated to deploy, the Scorestack maintainers curate a series of deployment scripts that can be used to deploy Scorestack to a variety of environments. If the environment you need is not covered here, please consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/scorestack/scorestack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature%2C+new&template=feature_request.md&title=) explaining what deployment options you'd like to be added.

Architectures
-------------

The following Scorestack architectures are available for deployment. If you aren't sure which one to choose, try the Small architecture.

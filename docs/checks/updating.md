Updating Check Definitions
==========================

If you are just developing your check definitions and not actively running a competition, you can update check definitions by just running the `add-team.sh` script. It is rare, however possible, that this can cause Dynamicbeat to take longer than normal to pull the latest check definitions from Scorestack if you are updating them at the same time that Dynamicbeat tries to pull them.

Scorestack Design
=================

This section of the documentation explains the current design of the Scorestack implementation. This section intends to be _descriptive_, not _prescriptive_. That is to say, if something in this section is incorrect, the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual state of Scorestack, instead of updating Scorestack to match what the documentation says.

If you just want to get Scorestack up and running for a competition, you can probably skip this section. The intended audience is current or future Scorestack developers. However, if you find that Scorestack doesn't _quite_ cover your use case, then you might find something in this section that could assist you.
